## Tomaka17's lua wrapper

### What is this library?
This lua wrapper for C++ is a library which allows you to easily manage lua code. It was designed to be as simple as possible to use.

### Why this library?
You may wonder why I chose to create my own library while there as so many other libraries available. Well, none of them 100 % satisfied me.

Some are just basic wrappers (with functions to directly manipulate the stack), some others use an external executable to compute the list of functions of a class, and some others are just too complicated to use.

This library was designed to be very simple to use: you can write lua variables (with either a number, a string, a function, an array or a smart pointer to an object), read lua variables, call functions stored in lua variables, and of course execute lua code. That's all.

### How to use it?
This is a headers-only library.
Simply include the file `include/LuaContext.hpp` in your code, and you can use the `LuaContext` class.
You can also just copy-paste it into your own source code if you don't want to modify your include paths.

The `include/misc/exception.hpp` file is required only for VC++.

All the files outside of the `include` directory are only for testing purposes and can be ignored.

### Why should I use it?
* very easy to use
* no macros (we are in the 21st century!)
* no external program to run on your source code
* not intrusive, you don't need to change the layout of your functions or classes
* you aren't forced to use object-oriented code
* portable (doesn't use anything that is compiler-specific or platform-specific)
* can do everything other libraries can do

### Why should I not use it?
* requires support for [C++11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11), the latest C++ standard
* requires [Boost](http://boost.org) (headers only)
* inheritance not supported (and won't be supported until some reflection is added to the C++ language)

### I have the old (2010) version of your library, what did change?
* you need an up-to-date compiler now
* you now need some headers-only library from boost
* breaking change: `LuaContext` is no longer in the the `Lua` namespace
* breaking change: you can't pass directly lambdas to `writeVariable` anymore, use `writeFunction` instead or convert them to `std::function`
* breaking change: there is no more `clearVariable` function, you have to write `nullptr` instead
* a lot of features have been added: lua arrays, polymorphic functions, etc.
* the implementation is really a lot cleaner, and probably faster and with less bugs

### Examples
All the examples are in C++, except of course the parameter passed to `executeCode`.

#### Example 1: reading and writing variables

    LuaContext lua;
    lua.writeVariable("x", 5);
    lua.executeCode("x = x + 2;");
    std::cout << lua.readVariable<int>("x") << std::endl;

Prints `7`.

All basic language types (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `char`, ...), plus `std::string`, can be read or written.

An exception is thrown if you try to read a value of the wrong type or if you try to read a non-existing variable.
If you don't want to have exceptions or if you don't know the type of a variable in advance, you can read a `boost::optional` and/or a `boost::variant`. More informations below.

#### Example 2: giving functions to lua

    void show(int value) {
        std::cout << value << std::endl;
    }

    LuaContext lua;
    lua.writeVariable("show", &show);
    lua.executeCode("show(5);");
    lua.executeCode("show(7);");

Prints `5` and `7`.

    LuaContext lua;
    lua.writeVariable("show", std::function<void (int)>{[](int v) { std::cout << v << std::endl; }});
    lua.executeCode("show(3);");
    lua.executeCode("show(8);");

Prints `3` and `8`.

`writeVariable` supports both `std::function` and native function pointers or references.
The function's parameters and return type are handled as if they were read and written by `readVariable` and `writeVariable`.

If you pass a function object with a single operator(), you can also auto-detect the function type using `writeFunction`:

    LuaContext lua;
    lua.writeFunction("show", [](int v) { std::cout << v << std::endl; });


#### Example 3: writing custom types

    class Object {
    public:
     Object() : value(10) {}
     
     void  increment() { std::cout << "incrementing" << std::endl; value++; } 
     
     int value;
    };
    
    LuaContext lua;
    lua.registerFunction("increment", &Object::increment);
    
    lua.writeVariable("obj", Object{});
    lua.executeCode("obj:increment();");

    std::cout << lua.readVariable<Object>("obj").value << std::endl;

Prints `incrementing` and `11`.

In addition to basic types and functions, you can pass any object to `writeVariable`. The object will then be copied into lua.
Before doing so, you can call "registerFunction" so lua scripts can call the object's functions just like in the example above.

`readVariable` can be used to read a copy of the object.

If you don't want to manipulate copies, you should write and read pointers instead of plain objects. Raw pointers, `unique_ptr`s and `shared_ptr`s are also supported.
Function that have been registered for a type also work with all pointers to this type.

However, inheritance is not supported.
You need to register all of a type's functions, even if you have already registered a type's parent's functions.


#### Example 4: reading lua code from a file

    LuaContext lua;
    lua.executeCode(std::ifstream{"script.lua"});

This simple example shows that you can easily read lua code (including pre-compiled) from a file.

If you write your own derivate of std::istream (for example a decompressor), you can of course also use it.
Note however that `executeCode` will block until it reaches eof. You should take care if you use a custom derivate of std::istream which awaits for data.


#### Example 5: executing lua functions

    LuaContext lua;

    lua.executeCode("foo = function(i) return i + 2 end");

    const auto function = lua.readVariable<std::function<int (int)>>("foo");
    std::cout << function(3) << std::endl;

Prints `5`.

`readVariable` also supports `std::function`. This allows you to read any function, even the functions created by lua.

The only types that are supported by `writeVariable` but not by `readVariable` are native function pointers and `unique_ptr`s, for obvious reasons.

**Warning**: calling the function after the LuaContext has been destroyed leads to undefined behavior (and likely to a crash).


#### Example 6: polymorphic functions

If you want to read a value but don't know in advance whether it is of type A or type B, `writeVariable` and `readVariable` also support `boost::variant`.

    LuaContext lua;

    lua.writeFunction("foo", 
        [](boost::variant<std::string,bool> value)
        {
            if (value.which() == 0) {
                std::cout << "Value is a string: " << boost::get<std::string>(value);
            } else {
                std::cout << "Value is a bool: " << boost::get<bool>(value);
            }
        }
    );

    lua.executeCode("foo(\"hello\")");
    lua.executeCode("foo(true)");

Prints `Value is a string: hello` and `Value is a bool: true`.

See the documentation of [`boost::variant`](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/variant.html).


#### Example 7: handling lua arrays

`writeVariable` and `readVariable` support `std::vector` of `std::pair`s, `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`.
This allows you to read and write arrays. Combined with `boost::variant`, this allows you to write real polymorphic arrays.

If you have a `std::vector` which contains `std::pair`s, it will be considered as an associative array, where the first member of the pair is the key and the second member is the value.
    
    LuaContext lua;

    lua.writeVariable("a",
        std::vector< std::pair< boost::variant<int,std::string>, boost::variant<bool,float> > >
        {
            { "test", true },
            { 2, 6.4f },
            { "hello", 1.f },
            { "world", -7.6f },
            { 18, false }
        }
    );

    std::cout << lua.executeCode<bool>("return a.test") << std::endl;
    std::cout << lua.executeCode<float>("return a[2]") << std::endl;

Prints `true` and `6.4`.

You can also use `readVariable` to directly read inside an array.
    
    std::cout << lua.readVariable("a", "test") << std::endl;
    std::cout << lua.readVariable("a", 2) << std::endl;

Remember that you can create recursive variants, so you can read arrays which contain arrays which contain arrays, and so forth.

    typedef typename boost::make_recursive_variant
        <
            std::string,
            double,
            bool,
            std::vector<std::pair<
                boost::variant<std::string,double,bool>,
                boost::recursive_variant_
            >>
        >::type
            AnyValue;

    lua.readVariable<AnyValue>("something");

This `AnyValue` can store any lua value, except functions and custom objects.

#### Example 8: returning multiple values

    LuaContext lua;
    lua.writeFunction("f1", [](int a, int b, int c) { return std::make_tuple(a + b + c, "test"); });

    lua.executeCode("a, b = f1(1, 2, 3);");
    
    std::cout << lua.readVariable<int>("a") << std::endl;
    std::cout << lua.readVariable<std::string>("b") << std::endl;

Prints `6` and `test`.

Lua supports functions that return multiple values at once. A C++ function can do so by returning a tuple.
In this example we return at the same time an int and a string.

#### Example 9: destroying a lua variable

    LuaContext lua;
    
    lua.writeVariable("a", 2);

    lua.writeVariable("a", nullptr);        // destroys a

The C++ equivalent for `nil` is `nullptr`.
